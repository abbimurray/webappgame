<h1>Welcome to Word Game 4!!</h1>
<h2>How to play...</h2>
<p>You are provided with a word of eight letters or more which we will call "sourceword". You are to think up seven 4-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the sourceword, ensuring that:</p>
<div class="how-to-play">
<ol>
    <li>Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.</li>
    <li>You haven't reused any letter more times than it appears within the sourceword.</li>
    <li>Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a "real" word).</li>
    <li>The words all have four letters or more.</li>
    <li>There are no duplicate words.</li>
    <li>None of the seven words is the source word.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Case is NOT significant (i.e., This, THIS, and this are the <em>same</em> word).</p>

<div class="buttons">
    <button onclick="window.location.href='/play';">Let's Play</button>
    <button onclick="window.location.href='/log';">Display Log</button>
</div>
