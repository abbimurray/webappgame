 <h2>Welcome to Word Game 4!!</h2>
	<h3>How to play...</h3>
		<p> You are provided with a word of eight letters or more which we'll call the "sourceword".<br>
		<br>You are to think up seven 4-or-more letter words made up from the letters contained within the sourceword, ensuring that:
		<br>
		<ol>
			<li>Each word is only made up from the letters contained within the sourceword.</li>
			<li>You haven't reused any letter more times that it appears in the sourceword.</li>
			<li>Each word exists within the dictionary (i.e., it's a “real” word).</li>
			<li>The words all have four letters or more.</li>
		        <li>There are no duplicate words.</li>
		        <li>None of the seven words is the source word.</li>    
		</ol>
    		<b>Note:</b> case is NOT significiant (i.e., This, THIS, and this are the *same* word).
